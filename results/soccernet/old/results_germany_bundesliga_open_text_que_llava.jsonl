In the left frame, the ball is closer to the corner flag, indicating that it has just been taken or is about to be taken. In the right frame, the ball is further away from the corner flag, suggesting that it has been played from the corner and is now in the middle of the pitch. The players' positions also support this, as they are more spread out in the left frame, which is typical of a corner kick just being taken."}
